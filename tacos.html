    <h3><em>Arizona Tacos</em></h3>
    <p>These crispy fried beef tacos—sometimes called "Arizona Tacos"— are having a moment on TikTok. You press the raw meat onto the tortilla before frying the whole thing for the ultimate crunchy exterior with a tender, juicy filling. And they're easy to make—here's how.</p>
    <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
    <p>Use a lean ground beef to save on grease. Use the side of the skillet to help flip and stabilize the taco as you fold. Don’t skip the paper towel-lined plate – these are pretty greasy and just a rack won’t do.</p>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <em><li>8 (5 inch) Corn Tortillas</li></em>
        <em><li>1 Pound Ground Sirloin</li></em>
        <em><li>2 Tablespoons Taco Seasoning</li></em>
        <em><li>3/4 Teaspoon Kosher Salt, Divided</li></em>
        <em><li>1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil, Or As Needed For Frying</li></em>
        <em><li>1/2 Cup Minced White Onion</li></em>
        <em><li>1/4 Cup Chopped Fresh Cilantro</li></em>
        <em><li>Lime Wedges, For Serving</li></em>
        <em><li>1/4 Cup Salsa, Or As Needed, For Serving</li></em>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Recipe Variations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use flour tortillas, but cook at a lower temperature.</li>
        <li>Try folding some shredded cheese into the beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Use ground turkey instead of beef.</li>
    </ul>
