    <h3>What Is Alfredo Sauce</h3>
    <p>Alfredo sauce is a creamy pasta sauce that's frequently paired with fettuccine. The iconic dish, fettuccine Alfredo, is an Italian menu staple. According to legend, the dish was invented by a Roman chef named Alfredo di Lelio in the early 1900s. Di Lelio's pregnant wife was struggling to keep any food down, so he tossed pasta in the simple buttery sauce of his own creation. He added fettuccine Alfredo to his restaurant's menu soon after.</p>
    <h3>Alfredo Sauce Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Traditional Alfredo sauce consists of butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and basic seasonings such as salt and pepper. This simple recipe, though, has a secret ingredient that speeds up the cooking process and makes it extra indulgent: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-cream-cheese/">cream cheese</a>. Here's what you'll need to make Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>1/2 Cup of Butter</li></em>
        <p>You can't make homemade Alfredo sauce without butter. The thick, velvety base adds creaminess and rich flavor. Make sure to use real butter for the most indulgent results. If you use unsalted butter, make sure to add salt to taste.</p>
        <em><li>1 (8 Ounce) Package Cream Cheese</li></em>
        <p>Not only does cream cheese add thickness and pleasant tanginess, it eliminates the need to stand over the stove making a roux.</p>
        <em><li>2 Teaspoons Garlic Powder</li></em>
        <p>Two teaspoons of garlic powder add Italian-inspired flavor. For a stronger flavor, use fresh garlic.</p>
        <em><li>2 Cups Milk</li></em>
        <p>Whole milk adds creaminess, richness, and helps create the perfect smooth texture.</p>
        <em><li>6 Ounces Grated Parmesan Cheese</li></em>
        <p>Parmesan thickens the sauce and adds irresistible cheesy flavor. Grate your own block instead of using shredded cheese if you can. If you don't have Parmesan, you can try substituting Gruy√®re or mozzarella.</p>
        <em><li>1/8 Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper</li></em>
        <p>Aromatic black pepper adds depth and enhances the other flavors. It's the perfect finishing touch.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add cream cheese and garlic powder, stirring with a wire whisk until smooth. Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. Stir in Parmesan cheese and pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency. Sauce will thicken rapidly. Thin with milk if cooked too long.</li>
        <li>Toss with hot pasta to serve.</li>
    </ol>
